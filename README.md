# Employee Leave Management System

### Description

This application supports two roles: manager and employee. Employees can submit leave applications and monitor their status on the dashboard, where they can also see comments from their manager. Managers have the ability to view, approve, or deny leave requests. Both employees and managers can review leave balances on their respective dashboards. Approved leave requests are also displayed on a monthly leave calendar for a comprehensive view.
